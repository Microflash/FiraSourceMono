# Fira Source Mono

[![Fira Code 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/FiraCode-2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/tag/2)

A customized version of [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with some non-default stylistic sets baked-in

## Why?

I never liked the funky `r` or ampersand `&` of default Fira Code stylistic set. FiraCode 2 introduced alternative stylistic sets to address this problem. Unfortunately, many editors don't support stylistic sets. Hence, Fira Source Mono was born with my favorite stylistic sets (ss01 (sans-serif lowercase `r`), ss03 (traditional ampersand), ss19 (dotted zero)) baked-in.

## How?

The [TRACEBACK](./TRACEBACK.md) has instructions and scripts that I used to generate these fonts.
